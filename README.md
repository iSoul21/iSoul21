I’m iSoul21, a Computer Science / IT based in the Philippines.

I specialize in backend web development and also handle frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with experience in React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js. 

I’m currently working on Machine Learning and Data Analytics.

I primarily code in Visual Studio Code for web and ML projects, and use Kaggle for data analytics and datasets.
